Merkle Tree implementation in Python 


#Merkle Tree
also known as hash tree used for data verification and maintain data integrity  in general.


This is a tree data structure where each non-leaf node is a hash of it's child nodes.

-> This data structure allows for efficient mapping of huge data and changes can be easily identified

-> The ROOT HASH is used as the fingerprint of the entire data.
